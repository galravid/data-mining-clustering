# Data Mining – Clustering Analysis

This project explores **unsupervised learning techniques** for clustering multivariate data.  
The main focus is on applying and evaluating different clustering algorithms, including **K-Means** and **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**, on a dataset of parametric variables.

## Project Structure
- **Data-mining-clustering.ipynb** – Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis, implementation, and results.

## Methods
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Standardization of variables.
   - Dimensionality reduction for visualization (PCA).

2. **Clustering Algorithms**
   - **K-Means** clustering with varying numbers of clusters.
   - **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)** for probabilistic clustering.

3. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - **Davies-Bouldin Index** to measure cluster quality.
   - Visualization of clustering results.

## Results
- Comparison of K-Means and GMM clustering performance across different values of *k*.
- Identification of the optimal number of clusters based on evaluation metrics.
- Visual insights into how the data is grouped in lower-dimensional space.
